### Requirements

- Linux

- For C++ version:  [CImg library](http://cimg.eu/)  (unique .h already included)


### Execution

#### MATLAB / C-Mex
```
run main.m    %call NNSC_mex
```


#### C++

- Compilation:
```
make
```

- Execution prototype:
```
./NNSC -i img_name [-k superpixel_nbr(450)] [-m compactness(0.075)]  [-outm output_map_name(./res/labelmap.png)] [-outb output_border_name(./res/borders.png)]
```
- Execution with contour map:  (make test)
``` 
./NNSC -i ./data/test_img.jpg -k 350 -m 0.075 -outm test_img_labelmap.png -outb test_img_border.png
```
- Execution on an image list:  (make test_list)
```
./scripts/test_list.sh ./data/list_file.txt ./data/ 350 0.075
```


### Data

The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD): containing 500 images of size 321x481 pixels with segmentation and contour ground truths is available
